## Testing

To test to see if you are running the program, run the command line, 'node index.js'. If you aren't prompted with questions to fill out, It may be a few things.\n One possible issue is you are not directed in the proper location for the terminal. Run the command, 'pwd', in the terminal to see where you currently are accessing on your computer. If you are not in the assets folder of this repo, direct your terminal there and  run the program again. It is possible that you may not have node downloaded. Please Check to see if you have it download by running the command line, "node -v" and see if you are given a response detailing the current version of node you are running if at all.
